# RCA System Implementation Roadmap

**Last Updated**: March 17, 2024  
**Project Status**: Milestone 1 Completed, Planning for Milestone 2

## System Evolution Overview

Our Root Cause Analysis (RCA) system evolves through three distinct milestones, each adding significant capabilities:

1. **Milestone 1: Basic RAG (Completed)** - Type-safe foundation with workflow visualization
2. **Milestone 2: GraphRAG (In Planning)** - Knowledge graph integration and strategic search
3. **Milestone 3: Agentic RAG (Future)** - Advanced reasoning with planning and tool execution

## Milestone Progression

The system capabilities progress through these key stages:

| Component | Milestone 1 (Completed) | Milestone 2 (Planned) | Milestone 3 (Future) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Agent-based | Strategy factory | Advanced agent coordination |
| **Retrieval** | Vector similarity | Graph-enhanced retrieval | Causal path retrieval |
| **Context** | Document chunks | Entity relationships | Temporal event sequences |
| **Reasoning** | Answer generation | Relationship inference | Root cause identification |
| **Azure Services** | OpenAI, AI Search | + Cosmos DB | + Container Apps, Functions |

## Implementation Summary

### Milestone 1: Basic RAG (Completed)

**Core Architecture**: Agent-based with typed tool system and workflow tracking
```
User Query â†’ Vector Search â†’ Document Ranking â†’ Response Generation
```

**Key Components**:
- âœ… Pydantic agent with typed tools
- âœ… Azure OpenAI and AI Search integration
- âœ… Document retrieval and ranking
- âœ… Response generation with citations
- âœ… HTML-based workflow visualization

**Technical Highlights**:
- Strict type safety with Pydantic models
- Workflow tracing for complete transparency
- Type-safe tool system with standardized interfaces
- Azure AI Search with vector embeddings
- HTML visualization for agent debugging and demos

### Milestone 2: GraphRAG (Planned - 4 Weeks)

**Enhanced Architecture**: Strategy-based with query understanding
```
User Query â†’ Query Understanding â†’ Strategy Selection â†’ Enhanced Retrieval â†’ Response Generation
```

**Key Components**:
- ðŸ”„ Query optimization with LLM
- ðŸ”„ Knowledge graph with entity relationships
- ðŸ”„ Multiple search strategies (Global, Local, DRIFT)
- ðŸ”„ Community detection for contextual understanding
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced prompt management system

**Implementation Focus**:
- Week 1: Query optimization and prompt management
- Week 2: Knowledge graph integration and entity extraction
- Week 3: Search strategy implementation
- Week 4: Community detection and integration testing

### Milestone 3: Agentic RAG (Future - 4 Weeks)

**Advanced Architecture**: Planning-based with memory and tools
```
User Query â†’ Memory Retrieval â†’ Planning â†’ Tool Selection â†’ Tool Execution â†’ Response Generation
```

**Key Components**:
- ðŸ“… Short-term and long-term memory systems
- ðŸ“… ReACT and Chain-of-Thought planning
- ðŸ“… Flexible tool registry with runtime discovery
- ðŸ“… Causal analysis with event graphs
- ðŸ“… Explanation generation for root causes

**Implementation Focus**:
- Week 1: Memory system implementation
- Week 2: Planning framework with ReACT
- Week 3: Tool registry and execution
- Week 4: Causal analysis and event graphs

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation follows these principles:

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each milestone builds on the previous one
2. **Modular Architecture**: Components are decoupled with clear interfaces
3. **Type Safety**: Pydantic models throughout for validation
4. **Azure Integration**: Leveraging managed services for scalability
5. **Testing Focus**: Comprehensive tests with each component

## Current Status and Next Steps

**Current Status**:
- Milestone 1 has been fully implemented and tested
- Documentation has been updated with workflow visualization
- Planning for Milestone 2 has been completed

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Begin implementation of query optimization component
2. Set up Azure Cosmos DB for knowledge graph storage
3. Create prompt management system
4. Update the RCA agent to incorporate query understanding

**Long-term Roadmap**:
1. Complete Milestone 2 implementation (4 weeks)
2. Evaluate performance against Milestone 1 baseline
3. Begin planning detailed implementation for Milestone 3
4. Develop agentic capabilities with memory and planning
